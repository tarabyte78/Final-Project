      <p>Movies ipsum Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times. It’s just a flesh wound. You don’t frighten us with your silly knees-bent running around advancing behavior! No chance, English bedwetting types! I burst my pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you tiny-brained wipers of other people’s bottoms! What do you mean, an African or European swallow?</p>

      <p>Well, don’t. It’s just like those miserable psalms, always so depressing. No chance, English bedwetting types! I burst my pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you tiny-brained wipers of other people’s bottoms! Look, it’s my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can. Oh, but you can’t expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? Bravely taking to his feet, he beat a very brave retreat. A brave retreat by brave Sir Robin.</p>

      <p>Every time I try to talk to someone it’s ‘sorry this’ and ‘forgive me that’ and ‘I’m not worthy.’ You don’t frighten us with your silly knees-bent running around advancing behavior! What manner of man are you, that can summon fire without flint or tinder? Well, don’t. It’s just like those miserable psalms, always so depressing. She turned me into a newt! No chance, English bedwetting types! I burst my pimples at you and call your door-opening request a silly thing, you tiny-brained wipers of other people’s bottoms!</p>

      <p>But if he was dying, he wouldn’t bother to carve ‘Aargh.’ He’d just say it. You must return here with a shrubbery. Or else you will never pass through these woods—alive. It’s just a flesh wound. I thought your son was a lady. Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?</p>

      <p>Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot! She has been setting light to our beacon. Which I’ve just remembered, is grail-shaped. It’s not the first time we’ve had this problem. Well, don’t. It’s just like those miserable psalms, always so depressing. Please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let’s not bicker and argue over who killed who. Look, it’s my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can. You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest—with—a herring! What manner of man are you, that can summon fire without flint or tinder?</p>

      <p>What do you mean, an African or European swallow? Please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let’s not bicker and argue over who killed who. Well, now, uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I wait until nightfall, and then leap out of the rabbit, taking the French by surprise—not only by surprise but totally unarmed! Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see. We are the knights who say—Ni! She turned me into a newt!</p>

      <p>Please! This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let’s not bicker and argue over who killed who. On second thought, let’s not go to Camelot. It is a silly place. Are you suggesting coconuts migrate? There’s some lovely filth down here. Follow. But! Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived! Stop. Who would cross the Bridge of Death must answer me these questions three, ere the other side he see.</p>
